### Problem 2

```{r read and tidy}
# read data
homicide = 
  read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv", na = c("","NA","Unknown")) %>%
  
# create a city_state variable, a binary solution variable and make sure victim_age is numeric
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
         resolution = case_when(
           disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
           disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ 0,
           disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ 1),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>% 
  
# Omit 4 cities
  filter(
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
    city_state != "Dallas,TX",
    city_state != "Phoenix,AZ",
    city_state != "Kansas City,MO",
    city_state != "Tulsa,AL") %>%
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_sex, victim_race)
